Except that it doesn't entirely...\r\n>\r\n> You should mention that signaling about flow identifiers is necessary, but that is the responsibility of the protocol that defines the usage.  If you don't signal, how does a receiver know that flow ID 1 maps to usage foo and flow ID 2 maps to usage bar?\r\n>\r\n> Also, you should explain that there is no general limit to the flow identifier space, though protocols might want to provide mechanisms to limit usage to prevent resource exhaustion.  This will depend on the protocol, of course.  Some protocols might not expend resources when creating flow IDs.",

It seems like the draft infers that the presence of the transport parameter for DATAGRAM is sufficient, but I don't believe that to be the case.\r\n\r\nTake the case where a client offers three protocols for use via ALPN.  One of those might always include DATAGRAM support and so the client is obligated to offer the transport parameter.  But that does not imply that all three offered protocols support this extension equally.  You need a way to unambiguously signal that the combination of DATAGRAM and h3 are supported.  That means a setting.",
